We do:
🔹We use chi-square:(Relationship between TWO CATEGORICAL variables)
   Department vs Attrition(Done)

🔹 Problem Statement

Example:

Employee attrition leads to recruitment costs, training expenses, and productivity loss. Predicting attrition early helps HR intervene strategically.

🔹 Business Impact

Estimate something like:

Average replacement cost = X

If attrition reduces by 5%, savings = ₹X

Even rough assumption works.

This shows business awareness.

🔹 Objective

Clearly define:

Predict probability of employee leaving

Identify key drivers

Provide actionable retention insights

This sounds very professional.

🎯 Why This Strategy Works

Most students:

Jump directly to model training.

But Data Scientists:

Understand data + explain business meaning.

By doing only these 2 steps properly, your project quality increases 2x.
